* Course
In this course:
- You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.
- Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
  printf("hello, world\n");
}
#+end_src

- Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about algorithms.
- You will learn about memory.
- You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.
- You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.
- Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language calledÂ *Python*. Your code will look something like this:
  
#+begin_src python
print("hello, world")
#+end_src

- This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed from the earlier ones.
- We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web applications.
