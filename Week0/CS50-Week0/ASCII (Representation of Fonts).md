## So how does a Computer Represents a Letter like A???
----
Firstly in order to answer your question, ‘A’ is represented by the decimal number ‘65’ in a computer. That is in binary 01000001.

Now in order to explain it, there is a system that was set in place, called ASCII. ASCII is an acronym that stands for ‘American Standard Code for Information Interchange’.

This standard was setup to form uniformity in the representation of letters of English alphabets.

However, now the question arises, that if we use decimal numbers in order to represent letters and symbols what we’ll be using in order to represent let’s say 66 or 65 or 1 for example. So these numbers or any other numbers start to be represented by other numbers. Like if you hit 1 on the keyboards, the computer stores 1 as 49 and 2 is stored as 50.

However, inside a computer there is only the permutation of bits, all of the patterns of 0’s and 1’s. These patterns of 0’s and 1’s can be used to display many things on the screen. For example when you receive a text message you’ll only get to see the text that has been sent to you, you won’t be seeing any 0’s or 1’s or the decimal values like 65, 66 etc. The same way when you open up a spread sheet you’ll only get to see decimal numbers like 66, 73, 72 etc, you won’t be seeing any bit patterns. These bit patterns can also be used in order to represent a color.

The ASCII system is a very american, meaning that it only supports the American-English or in simple terms English, and it doesn’t support any other language. Let’s say, if you want to use any other language to send a message to your friend for example, you cannot do that because those letters are not supported under ASCII.

Each letter within the ASCII system only represents letters and symbols in a byte. A single byte can be used to represent a single symbol or letter, which means that with each byte their is the possibility of representing one of 256 letters or symbols. And we are well aware that with all that possibility it can only represent English letters and symbols.

So in order to solve this problem, a new system was set in place.
