There are 8 bits in a single byte. When we have all of the bits in a byte assigned 1, we get the value 255. It easy really:

|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|1|

So with that, all we need to do is to add the following values:

128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 255
