Along with pseudocode, _abstraction_ is an essential skill and concept within computer programming.

Abstraction is the act of simplifying a problem into smaller and smaller problems.

For example, if you were hosting a huge dinner for your friends, theÂ _problem_ of having to cook the entire meal could be quite overwhelming! However, if you break down the task of cooking the meal into smaller and smaller tasks (or problems), the big task of creating this delicious meal might feel less challenging.

In programming, and even within scratch, we can see abstraction in action.

While programming when your doing the same thing over and over again. Indeed, if you see yourself repeatedly coding the same statements, its like the case that you could program more artfully - abstracting away the repetitive code.

We can use the loops in order to remove the repetitiveness of the code. It helps in simplifying the code and removes the hurdle of repeating the same code over and over again.

We can also create user defined function to make it even more simpler. We just simply write a function using the define block in scratch and then giving it the code that we want to execute, the simply call that function block over and over again, whenever we need to.
