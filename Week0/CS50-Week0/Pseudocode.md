The ability to create *pseudocode* is central to one’s success in Computer Programming.

Pseudocode is a human-readable version of your code. e.g. The pseudocode for finding the name of that individual inside the phone book:

1. Pick up phone book
2. Open to middle of phone book
3. Look at page
4. If person is on page
5. Call person
6. Else if person is earlier in book
7. Open to middle of left half of book
8. Go back to line 3
9. Else if person is later in book
10. Open to middle of right half of book
11. Go back to line 3
12. Else
13. Quit

## → Merits of Pseudocode:

→ when you pseudocode before you create formal code, it allows you to think through the logic of your problem in advance.

→ when you pseudocode, you can later provide this information to others that are seeking to understand your coding decisions and how your code works.

Notice that the language within our pseudocode has some unique features. First, some of these lines begin with verbs like _pick up,_ _open,_ _look at._ Later, we will call these _functions_.

Second, notice that some lines include statements like `if` or  `else if.` These are called _conditionals_.

Third, notice how there are expressions that can be stated as _true_ or _false,_ such as “person is earlier in the book.” We call these _boolean expressions_.

Finally, notice how these statements like “go back to line 3.” We call these _loops_.
