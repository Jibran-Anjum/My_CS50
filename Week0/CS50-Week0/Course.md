In this course:

• You will be learning this week about Scratch, a visual programming language.

• Then, in future weeks, you will learn about C. That will look something like this:

`#include *<stdio.h>*`

`int main(void)`

`{`

`printf("hello, world**\\n**");`

`}`

• Further, as the weeks progress, you will learn about algorithms.

• You will learn about memory.

• You will learn about buggy code and what causes computer crashes.

• You will learn about data structures such as a hash table.

• Then, we will transition to a new, higher-level language calledÂ _Python_. Your code will look something like this:

`print("hello, world")`

• This class will give you a strong understanding of how recent programming languages developed from the earlier ones.

• We will also be looking at how we can use databases and third-party frameworks to build web applications.
