Pixels changing values over time or equivalently, a sequence of images that, over time, are changing on the screen. That is how videos are represented by the computer display. Normally, when you look at hollywood movies that are typically 24 FPS, which simply means that you're seeing 24 images per second. So it's not actually a picture in motion, it's actually a sequence of pictures. So in our mind is interpolating (new matter in view) that oh, this is smooth movement, but in reality it's actually a sequence of alot of pictures that we're seeing really fast.
