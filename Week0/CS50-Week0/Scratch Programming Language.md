Scratch is a graphical programming language. It was developed by MIT media lab.

How do You actually Program in Scratch.

To begin, drag the “when green flag clicked” building block to the programming area. Then, drag the `say` building block to the programming area and attach it to the previous block.

→ Notice ⇒ that when you click the green flag now, on the stage, the cat says, “hello world.”

This illustrates quite well what we were discussing earlier regarding programming:

Notice that the input `hello world` is passed to the function `say`, and the _side effect_ of that function running is the cat saying `hello world`.
