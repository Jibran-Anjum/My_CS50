The process of **Debugging** is the removal or finding a solution to the error that a programmer is facing within the source-code.

The *bug* can be *logical* or *syntactical*.

In *C* `printf` can be a diagnostic tool for debugging.

# Debugger
Programmers have created software for debugging, these software's are called **Debuggers**.

However, it's not a simple task to use a debugger.

## Rubber Duck Debugging
Rubber duck is a debugging technique in which you simply express your frustrations and problem that you're facing with your code with your colleagues or roommates or friends.

So don't try to solve a problem by simply staring at your computer screen or your problem for hours. Try to express those problems and share them with other people and that might let you realize the illogical situation that you've created within your code.
