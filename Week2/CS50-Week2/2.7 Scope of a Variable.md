# Variable Scope
Scope is a characteristics of a variable that defines from which functions that variable may be accessed.

## Types of Variable Scope
There are two types of variable scope;
1. **Local Variables**
2. **Global Variables**

-----

## Local Variables
Local variables can be accessed within the functions in which they are created.

## Global Variables
Global variables can be accessed from any function in the program.

------------

Why does this distinction matters? *For the most part, local variables in C are **passed by value** in function calls.*

When a variable is passed by a value, the **callee function** receives a copy of the passed variable, not the variable itself.

It means that the variable in the **caller function** is unchanged unless overwritten.

--------------

Things can get particularly insidious if the same variable name appears in multiple functions, which is perfectly fine as long as the variable name exists in different scopes.
