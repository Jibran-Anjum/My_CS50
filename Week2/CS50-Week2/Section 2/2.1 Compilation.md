# Steps

1. **First:** *The Code will be converted to assembly*
2. **Second:** *Then, the Code is converted to binary*

# How?
The command that we use in order to convert the source code to machine code is `clang`...
e.g

	clang -o hello hello.c

In the above example, the source code `hello.c` is converted to `hello` binary code or machine code more specifically.

The more simplistic way to do the compilation step, we use `make` instead of `clang`...
e.g

	make hello

The code above does the same thing. It converts the source code of `hello.c` into machine code in an another file called `hello`.
