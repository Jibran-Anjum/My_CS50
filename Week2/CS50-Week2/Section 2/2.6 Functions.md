# Function
*Technically we write a function in order to make our code more modular, so that whenever we want to change something within our code we simply just go to the block of code (function) that we want to do our changes and do our changes easily, without hunting for the location where the desired code is located.*

## Declaration of a Function

	function_type function_name(arguments_for_the_function);

## Calling of a Function

## Definition of a Function
