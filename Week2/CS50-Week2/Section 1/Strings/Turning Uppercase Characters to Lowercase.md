In order to convert uppercase characters, we need to take out the ASCII chart. There we are aware that both lower and uppercase alphabets have been assigned a distinct value. By further inspection, we find out that the difference between these two types of alphabets is 32.

So for lowercase, all we need to do is to add 32 to the uppercase value to get lowercase.
