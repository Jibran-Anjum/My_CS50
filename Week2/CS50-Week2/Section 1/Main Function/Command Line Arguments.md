A **Command Line** arguments, unlike an argument to a function, is just an additional word or key phrase that you type after a command at your prompt in your terminal window that just modifies the behavior of that command.

`clang -o hello hello.c`

In the command above, `-o` is a command line argument, it simply compiles the program and renames the executable file that it just created, that is `hello`.
