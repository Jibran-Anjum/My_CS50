A variable is a name that can store a value. That name can be x, y or z and can hold all sorts of values. Let's say that we want to assign an initial value to a variable called ‘counter’, we'll do it like this:

	// first comes the variable type in this example its int  
	// then the name of the variable in this example its counter  
	// then the assignment symbol (=)  
	// and then comes the integer value and the statements ends with a semicolon  
	  
	int counter = 0;
