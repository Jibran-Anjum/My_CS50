#+TITLE: Prime Numbers

* Background
Prime numbers are defined as whole numbers greater than 1, whose only factors are 1 and itself. So 3 is prime because its only factors are 1 and 3, while 4 is composite and not prime, because it is the product of 2 Ã— 2. In this lab you will write an algorithm to generate all prime numbers in a range specified by the user.

* Procedure
** Including the =stdio.h= library file
** Beginning the main function
** Initializing Variables
*** of =int= type
** Ask for input =range= from the user
** Write the algorithm to single out prime numbers from the provided range
