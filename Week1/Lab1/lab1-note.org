#+TITLE: Lab 1

* Determine how long it takes for a population to reach a particular size.
** For this example use llamas...

** Requirements

*** Variables
**** a variable that takes the starting size of the population

**** a second variable that takes the size of the population required

**** Algorithm (born each year = n / 3, died each year = n / 4)
***** a variable that stores the llamas born each year
***** a variable that stores the llamas die each year
***** total llamas is equal to starting size
***** while loop
****** Condition
******* if the total llamas each year is less than the required population of llamas

******* total llamas in a single year (*total llamas = total llamas + llamas born each year - llamas die each year*)

******* total repeat the process of finding the total llamas until it meets the required population
